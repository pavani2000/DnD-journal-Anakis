# Chapter 1: Red Larch

I feel very tired. I fought well today and I’m glad I did not die. At least, this time I saved myself instead of waiting for others to do so. I want to sleep right this moment but I realised I should spend a few minutes updating the journal before I forget today’s events. 

After an uneventful journey, we finally reached Red Larch early in the morning. The first shop we saw was that of Endrith Vallervow, the shopkeeper Tathnard wanted to pass a message to. In the shop was an old, hunched man dressed in haphazard clothing that suggested that he was not rich. He smiled at us widely as we entered and asked us what we were interested in. In his hand, he had a green book that was outlined in gold named, “Genealogy of the dwarfs of Mirabar”. My attention was on the book. We found out that the book was given to him by someone who claimed to be a Killboard Skipper from Womford. The old man mentioned that he had a lot of books with him. It cannot be a coincidence that this description matches that of Brolden Thaw, the guess only bolstered by the fact that he gave away the book on Mirabar dwarfs. 
When we asked the old man if he had any magical artifacts to sell, he nodded vigorously and quickly went into the other room to return with a chair. He and I are cut from the same cloth, except that he is worse at this. He wanted us to believe that the chair would move 1 cm every hour. Even if it is true, why would anybody want to buy this! No wonder his shop looked downtrodden! Paelias jokingly entertained the man by exclaiming in wonder dramatically. Erias was suggesting that we should watch the chair for an hour to see if it moves. Morgan and I were busy giggling at the back. The situation was, unexpected. I have gained a sense of camaraderie through battle, and it only grows bigger the more I spend time with the lot of them. What am I thinking! I am not even aware of their motivations for following the same path as me!

Deciding we should move on, we asked the old man if there was anything interesting in Red Larch. We learned that the town is famous for its crumble cakes, specifically the ones served at Helm at High. Since I have the ritual Identify, we thought we should cast it on the key to figure out what it does. It needed a pearl that is worth a 100 gp. We decided we should sell the gemstone for one, and the old man suggested we visit the clothing shop owned by Helverd Tarnlard. 
The shop looked as if it was vomited on by money. It had expensive decoration at the front and the inside looked luxurious. Helverd Tarnlard paid little attention to us and with an arrogant voice he flicked his hands towards his wife without looking up from his work. The wife greeted us and when we told her we were looking to sell a gemstone, she observed our clothes looking up and down, then, frowned. At this point, I was agitated. I hate people who flaunt their riches with no regard for people who cannot afford food. They were also extremely arrogant and the judgement from her eyes angered me. The group decided I should converse with her, but little did they know that my emotions were reeling. Morgan revealed that he worked for a mining company in Mirabar and identified the gemstone as jet, worth at least a 100gp. Knowing the arrogant noble brat would try down sell, I told her that we wanted to sell it for 200gp. She then dared to ask me if we stole it! Only based on our looks! I told myself that I should calm down, and I decided to lie instead of showing my anger. I was unable to think well, and I claimed that a dwarf gifted it to us did not help. That did not help much and at this point, I lost my patience. I made my eyes glow red and reminded her that there were four of us and two scrawny them. Before I could threaten her father, Morgan grabbed me and proceeded dragged me out of the shop as Paelias tried to switch the conversation to a more mellow tone. Yes yes, they were right that I could have persuaded her with a gentler tone but gods, I do not believe she deserves respect when she can judge us so quickly! No wonder we turn to thievery instead of asking for help! In the end, we ended up exchanging the gemstone for a pearl with no other profit. 
After that incident, we found ourselves in front of Helm at High. The downtrodden inn was opposite a more well-kept inn called the Swinging Sword. Morgan claimed that she was rich and that she deserved a good bed. Although I would find that snobby out of context, I understood she was not putting others down but herself up. The rest of us wanted to try the famous crumble cakes so we left Morgan. Considering it was quite early in the morning, Helm at High had only a few customers and a very drunk orc lady loudly demanding beer to the servers like a barbarian. The barkeeper approached us and seemed very ecstatic to offer us 4gp if we solved a riddle and then served the answer of that riddle to the drunk lady. The riddle went, “I flow the ocean, flashing in a red cave, swap me to show your passion, release me to show your hate”. The three of us sat there pondering it. Yet another riddle that we had little brains for. I suppose all the books I read did not particularly help sharpen my mind, dear Collector. 

After a while, Morgan returned to us and he took only a few seconds after we narrated the riddle before he answered, “Saliva”.
“That is correct indeed! Who is going to spit in her drink?”, the barkeeper asked, handing us a beer. We all stare at each other. After a small pause, Erias decided that he’d be our Martyr. As he spat into the drink, the half-orc lady turned to us and frowned. Seeing that, Erias proved to be a quick thinker, and drank the beer himself. That was smart! I am glad to have these people around, I wouldn’t mind not dying. The half-orc lady, who was named Zomith, chuckled at his action and approached him. She put her strong arms around him and pulled him close. Erias looked extremely uncomfortable. Morgan decides to intervene and asks her if she wants to wrestle. Zomith was quick to agree and enthusiastically invited him to sit. At first, they seemed well-matched in strength, then Zomith gave in to Morgan’s arms but the game shifted quickly and Morgan clearly let her win. That was a good idea indeed, as Zomith was starting to lose her patience when she found herself losing. I hate barfights as I prefer to enjoy my drink in peace. Thank Morgan. 
Revelling in her fake victory, she was loosened her tongue. When we mentioned the delegation, her expression turned sour. When she found out Morgan knew them, she was more annoyed. It seems Zomith was fired from her work in the farms of Beliard because she had gotten into a drunken brawl with a few members of the delegation! She gave us a name, Erianis, and mentioned that they had a few soldiers with them. They also bore a symbol, the same as the one on Morgan’s clock. A symbol of what looked like a mining drill with the word Arcanics and the letters RMG inscribed above it. 
 After we left the tavern, Morgan filled us in of his conversation with a Brother Ardon, a priest of Lathandar. He informed that there was a weird fog in the valley to the West of Red Larch and that the town itself has experienced unusual lightning that reeked of Fell Magic. After hearing this, Morgan seemed agitated and wanted to go to the Sumber hills directly to investigate. The rest of us preferred to be more prepared than we were. On that, Morgan returned to Brother Ardon who then led us to Galkes’s barber shop.
 
I figured I would trim my beautiful hair and frame my face better in the front as it is rare to find a barber who claims to be experienced with cutting around horns. As Galkes began to cut my hair, we heard a loud animated voice from the back. Lemen Greengoot, a shepherd, was surrounded by people as he talked about finding a strange gravesite surrounded by extremely large birds. The way he said it made it seem incredulous as he switched from having seen ten gravesites to just four. Regardless, it was still a clue, and the others asked him for details which Greengoot had none of. He offered to take us to the location, however. 
The gravesite was towards the east of Red Larch to the South of the Sumber Hills. After a half day’s ride, we reached the place to find that Greengoot was right about the grave and weirdly large birds high up in the sky. Laid in the four graves were: a male dwarf in artisan clothes, a female human soldier with the symbol of a red axe, a male human warrior wearing strange stony armor and a male human with white clothes lined with black feathers. Morgan immediately recognised the symbol of the red axe as that of the Mirabar army suggesting that the delegation was involved in whatever happened. Their arrow wounds and signs of bludgeoning suggested they were part of a skirmish. There were no clear footprints or an obvious pathway into the nearby forest that anybody could have taken in the area. 
It was night already and we decided to camp close to the edge of the forest. Of course, our luck was so good that there were a group of people camped in the exact spot we chose. Some of them were dressed like bandits. Deciding we might as well choose to either join them or fight them, we sent Morgan the invincible out as a decay while we hid just outside the light of the campfire behind trees. The group near the campfire had 3 unique people, supposedly in line with an oceanic theme. There was a female priestess dressed in a blue robe and two reavers who had a shield made of what looked like crab shells, and a sword lined with shark teeth. 
Morgan walks in on the far end of their camp and goes, “Hello”. They immediately drew their swords, and the priestess raised her hands. Learn to talk first! The priestess hurtled an accursed magic missile at her! What hospitality! Obviously, Morgan magically had the most niche spell for someone who doesn’t practice magic as their foremost skill. She deflected the magic missile successfully! Meanwhile, one of the reavers had taken notice of me. He failed to throw his spear at me, and it stuck itself at the tree I was behind. By this time, Erias had wisely sprinted towards the priestess and grappled her in a way she would not be able to cast spells. After Paelias blessed the lot of us, the reaver in front of me managed to wound me badly with his sword and I was not going to let another creature ever hurt me again! I may not be strong physically, but I wielded the arcane. Roaring and cursing at him, I let lightning course through my arms and punched him multiple times until he was fallen dead. 

Morgan finished the other reaver and Erias managed to weaken the priestess. The bandits’ resolves were breaking the more they saw their leader bleed. After the two reavers fell, they immediately dropped their swords and raised their arms in surrender. They proclaimed that they were only mercenaries hired by the Riverguard Keep and were ordered by a Jolliver Grimjaw to protect their trade. They had not expected to be involved in a fight of this scale. We let them go. 
We tied up the priestess to a nearby tree and shuffled far from her hearing to discuss our approach. She would not open her mouth at all! Not a word! Tired of her withdrawal, and seeing she was trying to off herself supposedly not wanting to be alive anymore, I kindly offered to make sure to keep her alive and drag her everywhere she went. The others pulled me away, AGAIN, and ushered me to be less threatening. We decided I cast Friends instead. Soon, my new bestie let her tongue loose. When I offered to do anything for her information, she said “Submit to the Hydra and drown your friends to receive my favor”. That was not happening of course, I switched to interrogating her hoping she’d not ask me to drown the others first. Tempting as a prank, did not want them to die, however. Her mission was to raid a caravan for its goods, but we had meddled before they could. The description of the caravan made it seem like it was not related to the delegation. She said that the graves were related to fights between cults and the delegation. The cults she named were Black Earth, and I suppose the man in stony armor must be from that one. The other was Howling Hatred but that did not make sense to me as Sophia was extremely different from the feather dressed man. The priestess, or the Hydra called themselves Crushing Wave. Oh my Collector, why would you chain me to such a pot of chaotic mess? Considering she could return to her people and inform her of us, I said, “We’re done. Kill her.”, as soon as the spell ended. I, I do not feel guilty about that. Especially after she had just attacked a group of strangers for no reason. It seems I have found myself willing to kill as long as it is necessary. The others were startled with how immediate and demanding I was, but well. They should fear me. 

Finally, some sleep. Erias is going to keep the first watch, then Morgan and then Paelias. Paelias mentioned that he did not require sleep and only needed 4 hours of meditation. I am not complaining about not having a shift, thank you.
