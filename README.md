# DnD-journal-Anakis
Journal maintained by tiefling Warlock, Anakis, throughout her DnD campaign (Princes of apocalypse)

_The journal is written in the perspective of my character in an ongoing DND campaign. Sometimes I write things my character wasn't supposed to know or make huge mistakes in my comprehension of an event. Aside from adding new content, I'll be making changes as I find out such mistakes._
