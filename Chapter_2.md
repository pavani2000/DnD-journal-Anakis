# Chapter 2: Feathergale Spire 

The others are setting up the campfire as I write. This morning I’d thought to switch Vicious Mockery for a stealthier cantrip, and on hindsight I wish I’d not decided against it. Today was eventful, and I also feel quite happy that I can still act well. 

As soon as we’d woken up, we decided to head towards the tower circled by the huge birds to the North. The others voted for a straightforward diplomatic approach, and later, I learned that Morgan had not realised the tower’s involvement with the delegation. I suppose I should begin to declare my observations better. Considering that the members of the spire probably were neither aware of our motivations nor our existence, I decided to follow the group. 

The tower was made of white limestone and marble and was adorned by statues of hippogriffs. It was set high on a cliff in the middle of a yawning canyon whose depth I could not fathom. It formed a natural moat of empty spacious air where you’d fall to your deaths rather than drown, and the only way past it was through a drawbridge or by riding a bird as Lemen Greengoot had observed. A small shutter just beside the drawbridge slid up when we rang the bell just outside. The head of a middle-aged human female popped up in the space. She was dressed in the same clothes we’d found in the grave, white with black feathers at the shoulder. Morgan decided to drop all secrecy and told them that he was searching for people who went missing in the Sumber Hills. The human then offered to show us around the tower. Whatever gets us in, I suppose. After opening the drawbridge, she introduced herself as Savrah and explained that they were Feathergale Knights originally from Waterdiep. Just beyond the entrance to the tower was a hall where more humans (who looked like rich, spoiled nobles) dressed in Feathergale Knight armor hung around in little groups talking to each other. As Savrah led us in, she explained that they were all hippogriff enthusiasts and tamed the beasts to use them as mounts. They were holding a feast today for their tenth anniversary. When we asked her if she’d heard about the strange fog or lightning in the hills, she suggested we talk to the tower’s Commander Thural Merosska. The hall led to a staircase that spiralled up too many levels. At the topmost floor, which we reached after 9 levels or so, was a garden with a beautiful view. From this height, we had a clear view of the canyons and the nearby hills. The roads that connected Red Larch to the other towns swirled around beautifully as if they were laid by the brushstrokes of a skilled painter. At the edge of the garden, stood a man who looked as regal as his name. Commander Thural greeted us with great enthusiasm befitting the charisma of a leader. We introduced ourselves and inquired about the rumors we’d heard. The only information he revealed was useless, “There are great evils roaming the Sumber Hills, it is filled with depraved cultists and useless readers”. He, then, invited us to their feast. 
Thural sat at the head of the table with our group seated closest to him. The other knights sat further with ale in their hands. The hall was filled with loud laughter and overlapping voices. The more they talked, the more we felt that we were dining with a cult. As he sat down, Thural laughed at something and then, asked us to share our adventures. Tired from the previous day, their merry disposition was not infectious. Morgan disregarded the request and pressed on for information. Commenting that we were too serious for their celeberation, he decided to concede that we should beware the tricky mists in the Sighing Valley, especially at night. 
Seeing that he will not open more than that, we began to narrate our run-in with Hydra bandits the previous night. Before we could finish it, the doors of the feast hall opened with fanfare and someone shouted, “The manticore is on the move!”.

Everybody rose up and began to prepare. Thural flourished a gold ring patterned with elegant feathers and proclaimed that whoever defeated the manticore would receive the ring. Like dragons to its treasure, we were. We declined the nearby knights’ offer to join our group on the hunt, but we accepted their tamed hippogriffs. I GOT TO RIDE A HIPPOGRIFF. The four of us flew out from the garden atop the majestic beasts. 

The manticore was easy to locate as its roar was loud enough to reach the horizon. You’d think we’d be inadept in the sky, considering our party heavily relies on the melee capabilities of a monk and a fighter, but the manticore quickly fell. It had launched a few of the spikes on its tail at Erias, but it had barely managed to hurt us significantly. The hippogriffs were very tame and did not frighten easily throughout the fight. After Erias had launched his spectral arms for a final punch, I had to speak to the hippogriffs, so they’d work together to pull out the manticore from the river. We were claiming its head for proof when Savrah approached us with congratulations. Talking of our bravery, she offered an invitation to join their organisation for a secret mission and “master the elemental air”. They way she’d phrased the entire thing, we were pretty sure they were a cult, rather than just hobbyists. I was about to ask what the mission would entail, thinking that would lead us to “secret” information, but Paelias and Morgan quickly declined the offer. Paelias also chose to explain that we were on our own mission and when Savrah tried to convince him, he offered her a few choice insults. Savrah rescinded her offer after hearing that and walked away from us looking very annoyed. Before she could leave us, we called out to her to remind her that we were yet to receive the promised prize. Sighing in exasperation, she accompanies us to the tower’s garden and left us with Commander Thural. 

We were careful to inform Thural of Savrah’s irritation towards our group and he made it clear that it was not her place to make an offer for recruitment. After he gave us the ring, he insisted that we deserved more than just the ring. He told us about evil monks who harbored evil at the Sacred Stone Monastery. The place had been a typical monastery until a week ago, after which people talked of tremors in the region and the monks had either turned bad or replaced by someone else. 
After our conversation, our group headed out the tower to discuss what we’d learned. That is when I had realised that I’d completely forgotten about the Feathergale knights’ involvement in the cult skirmish. I likely should not have mentioned it, as Morgan’s sense of urgency hit an all-time high. He was insistent that we find more information in the tower before we move on. 

We decided to first take a short rest under the shade of the nearby trees. When I settled in, Erias called for our attention and told us that he was reminded of his nightmare when Thural mentioned the evil monks. He looked devastated as he began to describe his dreams. He’d seen a group of monks raid his monastery. They’d raised their hands, as if to case a spell, and made the Earth split open and swallow the entire monastery! He’d found it horrifying as he saw the entire event take place in detail. His God, Solvanus, had talked to him right after, warning him that that his vision was to occur soon. He had also mentioned that a Marlos Urnrayne was likely involved in the matter. I am glad that Erias felt it appropriate to share this, clearly, it was not just our physical paths that are entertwined. The Sacred Stone monks, both from their name and Erias’ dream sound a lot like cultists that practiced earth magic. Given that one of the men in the grave had a stone armor, it is likely that they were involved with the delegation and that they are the Cult of Black Earth. Morgan noted that we’d met cultists that dealt with air, the Feathergale Knights, and with the earth and water. I suppose, we were yet to meet someone who dealt with fire. 

We ended up deciding to infiltrate the tower using the night’s darkness for cover. I offered to disguise myself as a cultist, and Paelias improved upon that by suggesting I play the dead guy in the grave. I manifested a head wound as an excuse for memory loss and as always, took a deep breath to let the imagined personality of a man broken by a fight take over mine. I, then, cast invisibility on Morgan and the two of us set out to the drawbridge. It was Savrah who answered the bell once again. Only this time, she exclaimed, “TOM, you are ALIVE?” and hurriedly opened the drawbridge. She ran towards me, clearly looking like a torn family member and I decided to take her in a hug when I realised my mistake. I’d disguised myself with illusion, as Paelias clearly did not like the idea of me wearing a dead man’s clothing, which means people’s hands would pass right through the clothing and my skin. Luckily, she did notice anything odd likely as her emotions were running rampant. I pulled back as soon as I realised. When she tried to get me to explain how I was alive, I acted like I was shot with pain and that I just needed to get the comfort of good food and a bed. It had been a while since I pretended to be someone else, and I thoroughly enjoyed how she fell for it so well. We entered the tower together and I hoped that Morgan was following us. 

I found myself seated at the feast table, trying to get Savrah to reveal details of Tom’s mission. She made it clear that she had no authority to know the mission’s details but was surprised when I mentioned the presence of dwarfs with guards. Puzzled by how my memory was very selective, she got too emotional for my liking and proclaimed, “How could you forget me?”. I decided to take advantage of her emotions and replied, “I don’t remember much but I remember you well. Only you. Please, I have to know more. Tell me our story. How did we meet?”. That’s how we learned that the Feathergale Knights were not knights, they were the Cult of Howling Hatred!! I pretended not to know what that was which seemed to make her suspicious of me. With love in her eyes still, she tried to hold my face as she ranted about how I should be able to remember “our” relationship. I pulled my head back before she could touch me, which seemed to make her more distrustful. At the corner of my eye, I could see a candlestick begin to float. It began to move slowly towards us and I tried my best to keep Savrah distracted. It stopped moving as it reached just behind Savrah, after which it went up high for a moment before it came down upon her head forcefully, revealing Morgan as Savrah passed out on the flow. Morgan’s grim face as she held the candlestick over the unconscious wife almost made me giggle out loud. I put my fingers near Savrah’s nose and felt relieved that she was still alive. Before I could relax, we heard a door open on the other side. Morgan quickly hid herself when a voice asked if everything was okay. Not realising that I was still using Tom’s voice, the knight, or rather the cultist came out of his room to investigate. He was part of the group that was sent out with Tom, and he had seen Tom die. Oops. When he mentioned that they’d left right after they saw Tom fall, I tried to turn the conversation on him by asking, “How could you? You saw me fall, but did not care to check if I was alive before you abandoned me?”. He was less gullible than Savrah, however, and would not stop questioning me. Before I could attempt to get out of the conversation, Morgan grappled him from behind and well, we threw his unconscious body along with Savrah’s in the two beds that were in the room he’d come out of. Hoping nobody would notice the bodies yet, Morgan and I decided to look for Thural’s room in search of more clues.

We had to open every single door as quietly as we could. Some of the doors were squeaky, and we were almost caught but we managed to persuade those who did awake to return to their sleep. We had to this for every door in two levels before I encountered a now awakened Thural, disguised as Savrah. Deciding to continue with the previous conversation as Tom, I stormed in demanding to know why Tom had to face more than the Black Earth cultists. Thural was very irritated that his sleep was disturbed, and he groggily revealed that their mission was to ambush the Black Earth monks, but the Black Earth monks themselves happened to have ambushed the Mirabar delegation at the exact same time. I decided that was enough of an explanation and left the room after a quick apology.

When we returned to Paelias and Erias, Morgan suggested that we destroy the cult and said we should rid the world of cultists who would let something like what we’d seen in Carleone happen. I was inclined to agree at first but Paelias explained that most cultists are usually unaware that they were part of a cult or that they were indirectly involved in murder. He was right indeed. I did think that we should do something about the unconscious man. Finishing him might be the best idea as he has seen Morgan and surely would inform the others of the ruse. Now that I am at rest, I wonder how I came to have such instincts. Am I as cold-blooded as those I hate? Even though I wonder this, I don’t think I feel guilty as murdering him only felt logical. After all, he was part of a cult that had vampires that murdered people ruthlessly.

When we voted on it, Paelias was vehemently against killing the cultists without being aware of those that were naïve and those that were cruel. Though he preferred to avoid tangling with the cult in any way, he partially agreed that we should be rid of the unconscious man to protect ourselves. Erias proclaimed that he was against killing anybody in general, but he would not watch us get into a fight without providing aid. Morgan was convinced that we should destroy the cult but seemed to calm down when Erias suggested taking down Thural in order to dismantle their organisation. I was not sure if I was okay with killing Thural, who seemed decent enough, so I decided to wait for Paelias’ decision as he was not inclined to murder without cause. While I waited for Paelias to voice his opinion, a large spider climbed up my shoulders and danced excitedly. I sighed, casting speak with animals, and the Collecter seemed drunk with excitement as he said with glee, “Murderrrrrr”. For a moment, the Archfey’s order made my heartbeat fast with anxiety. The fear that I would often be ordered to kill innocents filled me. After a moment’s thought I found that I was not as reluctant as I would have been if they hadn’t been cultists. They were very puzzled at why I would change my mind so quickly. In the end, we decided to only kill Thural. I was not ready to disappoint Paelias further, so I was hoping that the Archfey would be satisfied with half the murder he’d demanded. 

Paelias wanted no part of the violence and decided to stay outside the tower. The rest of us went directly to Thural’s room. It was Erias who did the job this time. It went quick, considering Thural was asleep. Erias searched his body and found a letter. When Morgan took the letter, the atmosphere changed. The more she read it, the more her frown deepened. I took the letter from her to read it and watched her storm downstairs with Erias on her tail. The letter said, “Merosska, we are pleased to hear about the outcome of your altercation with the Black Earth cult, and we praise you for the capture of one of their prisoners. This engineer from Mirabar has an interesting tale to tell, and we shall enjoy interrogating her further. Keep a close watch on Sacred Stone monastery. I want to know what our enemy is planning next. – Aerisi Kalinoth”. The delegation always proved to be a touchy subject for Morgan. Afraid of what her fury would lead to, I ran downstairs and caught up to Erias. We found Morgan with her weapon raised over Savrah’s unconscious body. Before she could strike, Erias caught her wrists. She trembled in anger but had enough presence of mind to agree when we insisted, we stick to our original plan. She spent a whole minute standing like that with an expression that made it seem like she was contemplating her entire life. I highly suspect that someone beloved to her was part of the delegation. I would have let her murder the entire tower if she felt it appropriate, I am not one to stand in the way of someone’s vengeance. The only reason I contributed to talking her down was that we had no evidence that the Howling Hatred was responsible in any way. If anything, her rage should be directed to the Black Earth. But who am I to judge someone who rages with fiery protectiveness? 

After a while, she looked determined and nodded before she walked towards the unconscious man. Even heightened with emotions, her execution was precise. I watched her as she then proceeded to use the wax from a blue candle nearby to write “Repent” on the wall. I found it both amusing and horrifying at the same time. I truly hope the cause of her fury is justified. 

We then moved Savrah’s body to her station at the drawbridge. We did not want it to look like she had murdered the man. Hopefully, they’d think that whoever was responsible had knocked Sarah down and had killed the man. 
While we were updating Paelias of the situation, the spider returned to my shoulder to tell, “Nooo murdderrrr” in an annoyed tone. My hair then turned a very very ugly shade of green, nothing I wasn’t used to already. I don’t react much to my punishments anymore. By the Gods, leave me be! The others noticed that immediately. Erias exclaimed with a squeaky voice, “There’s a spider on your shoulder!”. He was about to punch it when I threatened him with a fight if he finished that punch. Paelias looked at me, puzzled, and asked me why my hair turned green. I did not think it was a good idea for them to know that I was controlled by a trickster patron. For all they knew, I was a warlock with a temporary contract or with a patron who only occasionally gave tasks. I was ALWAYS on a task; I honestly don’t have a life outside this. I liked Paelias, so I was extremely reluctant to lie to him. When I told him that I had turned my hair myself, I could not really face him head on. He did not seem convinced with my reply. 

I am worried about Morgan. He wants to head to the Sacred Stone Monastery. By the sound of Erias’ dream, I was not sure if we would survive that. The moment they find out that we are looking for the delegation, I expect that they would let us fall to the ninth hell. It is time to ask the Collector next time he visits if he would provide me with more spells. I suppose he might, as it would be unusual for me to ask for anything other than removing the cuff on my horn.
