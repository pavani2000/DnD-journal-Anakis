# Chapter 2: Feathergale Spire 

The others are setting up the campfire. IT WAS A LONG DAY, AGAIN.  

This morning, I'd thought I should switch out Vicious Mockery for a stealthy cantrip which would have been useful very very useful had I not decided against it. 

There was a slight confusion in the decision on how to approach the spire. I felt quite drugged from sleep, and I was not feeling like talk. I kept quiet while the others discussed. It seems they forgot that the people of the Feathergale Spire were part of the cult skirmish that involved the delegation. Considering they do not know us and that they may not consider us as their enemies, I decided to follow the group. 

The spire was in the middle of a canyon. A drawbridge connected the nearby cliff to the tower and the gap in between seemed endless. The tower itself was made of white limestone and marble and had statues of hippogriffs on it. We rang the bell just outside the drawbridge. A small shutter opened in the wall to reveal a human woman dressed in Feathergale Knight armor. When we mentioned that we were looking for people who went missing in the Sumber Hills, she quickly opened the drawbridge and took us in. She offered to show us the tower and we agreed. Inside, a few people who looked like rich nobles were in conversation. She explained who they are as she walked us around. It seems they were hippogriff enthusiasts from Waterdiep who uses them as mounts. They were holding a feast just then for their tenth anniversary. When we asked her if she’d heard about the strange fog and lightning in the hills, she suggested we talk to Commander Thural Merosska. At the topmost floor was a garden which had a clear view of the canyons and nearby hills. Commander Thural greeted us with ceremony. We introduced ourselves and Thural ominously told us that there were great evils and depraved cultists in the hills. He then invited us to the feast. 

Commander Thural sat at the head of the table with our group seated the closest to him. The other knights were conversing merrily, and might I say, loudly in celebration. When we tried to get more information, Thural laughed and asked us to share our adventures on this merry day. Even though we’d rested well, the situations we have found ourselves in the recent days did not allow us to act merry. Commenting that we were too serious, Thural decided to concede that the mists in the Sighing Valley were tricky at night. We began to tell him the story of meeting the bandits the previous night when the doors opened and someone screamed, “The manticore is on the move!”. Thural flourished a gold ring patterned with elegant feathers and proclaimed that whoever defeated the manticore would receive the ring. Like dragons to its treasure, we were. We declined the offer of help from the nearby knights but took the extremely delicious offer of using their tamed hippogriffs. The four of us rode out on the majestic beasts.

The manticore was easy to locate as its roar reached the expanse of the endless sky. The manticore did not last the fight long but its body fell from the sky into the river. As the three of us would not be able to pull it out, I decided to make use of the Collector’s ring to request our hippogriffs to drag the manticore out. Just as we took its head as proof, Savrah approached us with congratulations. Talking of our bravery, she offered an invitation to join their enthusiast group on their secret mission and master elemental air. I was about to ask what the mission could entail as that would be reasonable for someone looking to commit would ask. However, Paelias and Morgan did not wait to vehemently refuse the offer. Paelias explained that we were on our own mission which required attention. He also managed to insult Savrah amidst that which annoyed her. Irritated, she rescinded her offer and walked away. Morgan called out to her and reminded her that we were yet to receive the promised prize. 

We returned to Commander Thural on the garden atop the spire. Savrah left us to our conversation. When we told Thural that Savrah was annoyed with us after we had refused her offer, he made it clear that it was not her place to offer. He gave us the ring and when we insisted we deserved to know more after everything, he talked of tremors and mentioned a monastery. The Sacred Stone monastery had been as normal as any monastery until a week ago. Thural said that the monks, or whoever may have replaced them, were harboring evil. He also talked of tremors in the region. 
After our conversation, we go out the tower to discuss what we had found. That is when I had realised that the others had not remembered the involvement of the Feathergale knights with the delegation at the cult skirmish. I likely should not have mentioned it as Morgan’s immediate reaction was, “Let’s kill them all”. His rage was familiar, the same as mine when Vex had been taken, I was unsure however if love was indeed the source for it. I hope so, that if it’s not love, that it’s at least duty to the good. 

We decide to take a short rest under the shade of the trees. After a minute of silence, Erias called for our attention and told us that he may have seen the monks of the Sacred Stone Monastery in his dreams. He looked pained and devasted as he began to describe his dreams. He saw a group of monks raise their hands as if to cast a spell at Erias’ monastery after which the earth split open burying the place! His God, Solvanus, talked to him in the dream saying that what he saw was to occur soon. My best guess is that his God sent him here and likely did not convey his intentions until this dream. I am glad, however, that Erias felt it appropriate to share because clearly it was not just our physical paths that were intertwined now. His God had also mentioned that a Marlos Urnrayne might have been responsible for this. 
Hearing this, Morgan suggested that the Sacred Stone Monastery was the location of the Cult of Black Earth. We have come across three of the four elements in this world. Water, Air and Earth. We wondered if whoever wielded fire would be more terrifying that the Black Earth. After the bout of wisdom, Morgan quickly lost it. He was insistent that we go back into the tower. The rest of us, Erias and Paelias especially, insisted we sneak in instead and try to search for information. Finally, we decided that I was going to disguise myself as the Feathergale knight we found at the gravesite and use the presence of a headwound as an excuse for the loss of memory. As always, I investigated my book to accrue the information we have of the knights and the dead man, took a deep breath to let the imagined personality take over mine. I then cast invisibility on Morgan and the two of us set out to the tower in the dark of the night. If things went wrong with the two of us inside the tower, we were to scream for help. Erias would then jump over the canyon, which only he can do, and let Paelias in.

This time when I, as the dead guy rang the bell, Savrah rushed out the drawbridge. She ran towards me screaming, “TOM, you are alive!”. Deciding that only a wife could behave this way, I caught her in a hug when I realised my mistake. I was using an illusion which only created a mirage over my face and anybody who touches my clothes would find that their hands fall through them. I immediately pulled back and created a distance. Fortunately, she had not noticed anything as she was extremely emotional. When she asked how I was alive, I acted like I was in extreme pain and that I just had to get some food. THE RUSH I HAD FOR THIS ENTIRE MOMENT WAS NOSTALGIC. It has been a while since I used my skills of pretense to be someone I wasn’t, and I am enjoying it now that I am not doing it only for money. We entered the tower and I hoped that Morgan was following us. I found myself sitting with Savrah at the feast table, trying to get her to explain what Tom’s mission was, under the guise of whether the mission was worth it for Tom to have nearly witnessed death. She was surprised that it wasn’t just a Black Earth monk at the skirmish, and she seemed at a low rung of hierarchy among the knights. At first, she was not satisfied with my loss of memory and when she asked what I could remember, I decided to take advantage of her emotions. I proclaimed that while I have some images from the fight that had injured me so, the only thing I could remember well was her. Brilliant. I had thought that would assuage her but instead she was annoyed that I could not remember how we met. I begged her to tell me that story when she revealed that they were the Howling Hatred! I pretended to not know what that was when she decided to try to hold my face. I immediately pulled back and that annoyed her further! I continued talking to her when I saw a candlestick begin to float in my periphery. It slowly moved stopping behind her after which it went up high for a moment before it came down upon her head forcefully revealing Morgan as Savrah passed on the floor. Her grim face as she held the candlestick almost made me giggle out loud before I found myself hoping Savrah wasn’t dead. Before we could relax, a door opened on the other side. Morgan quickly hid herself when a voice asked if everything was alright. Not realising that I was still using Tom’s voice, the knight, or rather the cultist came out of his room to investigate. He claimed that he saw me die when I said, “I did fall” to which he insisted that he saw me fall before they’d walked away. I immediately acted as if in pain and repeated, “You... you left? You saw me fall and you left?”. The man refused to be distracted and insisted on answer. Satisfied with my lies, he was about to leave when he noticed Morgan move as she went behind him to grapple her. With another person passed out, we moved the two bodies to his room and placed them on the beds hoping nobody would notice the bodies until we were finished with our investigation and were out of the tower. 

We decided to find the Thural’s room. We had to open every single door as quietly as we could. We were caught a few times, but we managed to persuade those who did wake up to return to sleep. Their grogginess helped. I was the one who opened the door to Thural’s. I should establish that for someone that could turn themselves invisible, I am not sneaky. I’d rather use disguises and walk straight into the lion’s den. Morgan had suggested that I disguise as someone else instead of Tom as that would raise a lot of questions if caught and so, there I was at Thural’s door as Savrah. Embodying the wrath of a wife, I walked in demanding why Tom was sent to not just the Black Earth but also to a group of dwarfs and soldiers bearing red axe symbols. Thural seemed very irritated to have been disturbed and sluggishly said that the Black Earth was ambushing the Mirabar delegation when they had decided to ambush the monks. At this, I apologised for doubting him and returned outside. 
We returned to Paelias and Erias to inform them of what we’d learned. Morgan suggested that it was best we rid the world of this cult as they were evidently dangerous. I was inclined to agree before Paelias explained that most cultists are unaware of the actions of their cult. He was right indeed. I did think that we should do something about the unconscious man. Finishing him might be the best idea as he had seen Morgan and likely was sure to inform the others of the ruse. Now that I am in rest, I am not sure where these instincts are coming from. Am I as cold-blooded as those I hate? Even though I wonder this, I do not seem to feel guilty as murdering him only felt logical, and he was part of a cult that bred vampires and killed people. 

When we voted on it, Paelias was vehemently against killing without knowing who was naïve and who was cruel and partially agreed that we should be rid of the unconscious man. Erias was against killing anybody but seemed to understand the necessity of ridding the man. Morgan was convinced that we should destroy the cult, while I proclaimed that I was going to follow Paelias’ advice. Immediately, I felt a spider crawl over my shoulder and wiggle in a frenzy until I quietly cast speak with animals. The Collector said, “Murderrrrr”, with a gleeful and excited tone. Sighing out loud, I told them that I’d changed my minded and that I supported Morgan. 
For a moment, the Archfey’s order created fear in me. The fear that I would often be ordered to kill innocents. After a moment’s thought I found that I was not as reluctant as I would if they hadn’t been cultists. They were very puzzled at why I would change my mind so quickly, but I was not ready to explain the sorrows of my life to them. Paelias seemed to take note of the spider on my shoulder but did not acknowledge it. Morgan suggested we at least kill their leader to dismantle their organisation. Paelias felt that was unnecessary and decided to stay out. I was losing my patience as I just wanted the spider gone from my shoulder and agreed. I do not like being watched. 

The three of us then proceeded to return to the tower. Morgan insisted we at least kill Thural so we can decentralise their organisation. Agreeing that it was a sound tactical decision, Erias did the deed. In Thural’s chest, we found a letter. It went,
“Merosska, we are pleased to hear about the outcome of your altercation with the Black Earth cult, and we praise you for the capture of one of their prisoners. This engineer from Mirabar has an interesting tale to tell, and we shall enjoy interrogating her further. Keep a close watch on Sacred Stone monastery. I want to know what our enemy is planning next”. It was signed by a Aerisi Kalinoth. 

When Morgan read the letter, her face darkened. She hurried downstairs as Erias, and I trailed behind her. When she raised her weapon intending to use it on the unconscious Savrah, Erias caught her hand to stop her. She trembled in anger as we spoke to her, but was quick to agree that we should stick to our original plan. Nodding, she turned to execute the unconscious man. Erias and I watched, as Morgan then took the blue candle burning on the table to write “Repent” on the wall above the corpse. 

We then moved Savrah’s body to the shutter in the wall at the drawbridge and left her there. We did not want it to look like she had murdered the man. Hopefully, they would think that whoever was responsible had knocked Savrah down and then killed the man. 

We walked out to Paelias to update him of the situation. Amidst the conversation, the spider returned to tell, “No murrrderrr” with an annoying tone before my hair turned an ugly green. PLEASE! The others noticed that immediately. Erias said, “There’s a spider on your shoulder!” and was about to punch it when I threatened him with a fight if he chose to do so. Paelias looked at me quizzically and asked me, “Why did your hair turn green?”. I did not think it was a good idea for them to know that I was being controlled by a trickster patron. For all they knew, I was a warlock with a patron who did not meddle as much in my life, or a contract that was temporary. I liked Paelias and I was extremely reluctant to lie to him. So, when I told him that I did it myself, I could not face him, and I looked down at the floor scratching my horn. He was not convinced with my answer. 

I am worried about Morgan. I am deeply sure that she has her reasons, and they would be justifiable. Would she be so quick to kill someone without evidence of their true nature? Would I be? If the Archfey were to order me to harm someone she cares for in any way, would she kill me? There is no use pondering this, I shall talk to her about her intentions when I get the chance. 

Erias. Erias must be defended. He is as innocent as they come. Although, we may be chipping away at it considering he had just committed his first killing. 
Paelias. A part of me yearns to follow his path, yet I can see myself torn between wanting to aid Morgan’s vengeance and choosing to judge each individual instead of the cult as a whole. 

Morgan wants to walk into the Sacred Stone monastery. I am not sure if we would survive that. The second they know we are looking for the delegation, I expect they would let us fall to whatever lies underneath the ground. It is time to ask the Collector next time he visits if he would provide me with more spells. I suppose he might as it would be unusual for me to ask for anything other than removing the cuff on my horn.
